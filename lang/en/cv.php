    The year of covid 2020 when the market was going down so low, I massively invested

    Currently, when the market is going down 35%, I did not even lose money
    for my stock portfolio. And I saw the huge opportunities with the current market so
    I decided to quit my senior software engineer job to build my Stock Price Calculation software
    and pursue my new career path as a stock analyst.
    In fact, I\'m quite confident with my stock analyzing skills
    that over the long term (1-5 years) more than 90% of my decisions will be right,
